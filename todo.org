* Features

** TODO Use Amazon SES to send emails (instead of localhost)
** TODO Deploy to server with crontab so I get an email every night at 8pm
** TODO Write a README.md
** TODO Add a SQLite DB that keeps track of the current level for each different plugin

The score for each plugin can be recalculated each day and may go up and down, but the level never goes below the previous highest level reached

** TODO Add an HTML outputter so I can put this up as static content at www.mpdaugherty.com/lifeScore and check my stats and levels!
** TODO When I go up a level, add a special note to the email

* Plugins

** TODO After setting up my blog, add a plugin that scores how many comments I've received in the last month
** TODO Write a plugin for fitocracy.  Should be straightforward:
** TODO Write a plugin for idonethis.com (?)
