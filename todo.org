** DONE Deploy to server with crontab so I get an email every night at 8pm

** TODO Write a README.md
** TODO Add a SQLite DB that keeps track of the current level for each different plugin

The score for each plugin can be recalculated each day and may go up and down, but the level never goes below the previous highest level reached

** TODO Add an HTML outputter so I can put this up as static content at www.mpdaugherty.com/lifeScore and check my stats and levels!
** TODO When I go up a level, add a special note to the email
** TODO Scoring across plugins:

Idea: Rank plugins, use LAAAM calculation for weight.  Then, multiply
their levels and add up using the LAAM methodology (therefore, no big
advantage to adding lots of goals; really only the first 3-4 make much
of a difference).  Round down to get level.

To figure out points and progress to next goal, can use % to next
level + remainder from the LAAAM calculation.  (Then normalize it
across an increasing # of points per level)

* Plugins

** TODO After setting up my blog, add a plugin that scores how many comments I've received in the last month
** TODO RescueTime
** TODO Write a plugin for fitocracy.  Should be straightforward:

http://fitocracy-api.heroku.com/ (there's currently some issue, so it's not answering curl requests)

Also, profiles are hidden unless the user logs in.  I could write my
own unofficial API like the fitocracy-api.heroku.com?  I log in with
my username/pass and get info; make it available over HTTP?  Request
from the same IP address have to wait 10min in between?

** TODO Write a plugin for idonethis.com (?)
